# Web Snake Game
## Author: Joel Lozano

Simple Snake game web app written in Javascript. I decided to build this game to
get some hands-on practice with basic web development.

## To Play:

Run nodeserver.js in a terminal and navigate to localhost:8080 in a browser window.
That's it!

Sound effects downloaded from youtube.com.
